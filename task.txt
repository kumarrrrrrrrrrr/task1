    Q) Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2?

For every TCP connection there is only one request and response. But HTTP/1.1 supports connection reuse

Uses multiplexing, over a single TCP connection. It is done using streams and it also provide feature called server push. 
Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about status of message(24 status code) and its error reporting is quicker and efficient
Headers and status code of HTTP remains same.
It uses digest authentication and NTML authentication
Security concern from previous version will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However it is better equipped to deal with them 
It has additional header like cache-control
Does not change much in terms of caching with server push. If the client find resource present already in cache it cancel the push stream
Text Based protocol that is in the readable format
It is a binary protocol
